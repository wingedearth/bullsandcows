#BULLS AND COWS
###with Ionic

##Summary:
Bulls and Cows is an old British code breaking game played by two
players. The traditional game begins when one player to sets a secret 
codeusing four values each of which may be selected for each of four
positions. The game may also be played with 3 or any other 
number of values. The goal of the game is for the second player to 
accurately guess each value in each position.

Every round, the second player guesses the value of each position,
after which the guesses are scored. A "Cow" means a correct value
but in the wrong position, while a "Bull" means a correct value
in the correct position.

The present game is a computer simulation of Bulls and Cows in which
the first player's role is filled by the software using random
choices to place the secret code.

A computer program moo, written in 1970 by J. M. Grochow at MIT in the 
PL/I computer language for the Multics operating system, was amongst 
the first Bulls and Cows computer implementations, inspired by a 
similar program written by Frank King in 1968 and running on the 
Cambridge University mainframe. Because the game has simple rules, 
while it is difficult and entertaining, there are many computer 
variants; it is often included in telephones and PDAs.
